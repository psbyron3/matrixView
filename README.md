## Welcome to MatrixView ##

This is a (super) small app that creates a matrix view in your browser. If you want to make any changes or PR feel free. Fork the repo and send PR from your fork to 'dev' branch. 

There are some customizable properties. You can change the color of the characters or the characters themselves to spell out a name or a place, etc. to edit the characters you plugin unicode values into the .fromCharCode method.

This is designed for fun, and it is super simple! Hope you enjoy.
